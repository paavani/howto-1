Goal of normalization is to eliminate redundency								
								
Three forms of nomalization as stated by inventor of relational databases, E.F. Codd's								
								
1NF	No Repeating columns and every row is unique							
2NF	All attributes should depend on full primary key							
3NF	All attributes should directly(nontransitively) depend on primarykey.							
								
								
1NF								
								
Person								
ID	Name	Email	Phone	Child1	Child2	Child3		
1	koti	k@i.com	988	a	b	c		--> No space for 4th child if any
2	kanna	j@p.com	438	k	p			-->waste of space as he has only 2 children
3	chinna	i@n.com	7966					--> waste of space as he doesn't have any children
								
Person								
ID	Name	Email	Phone		ID is primary key			
1	koti	k@i.com	988					
2	kanna	j@p.com	438					
3	chinna	i@n.com	7966					
								
								
PersonChild								
ID	Seq	Child			ID & Seq is composite primary key			
1	1	a						
1	2	b						
1	3	c						
2	1	k						
2	2	p						


2NF	All attributes depend on full primary key			
				
				
PersonProject				
PersonID	ProjectID	PersonName	ProjectCode	ProjectName
1	1	anil	Proj1	
2	1	sunil	Proj1	
3	1	binil	Proj1	
4	1	livil	Proj1	
1	2	anil	Proj2	
2	2	sunil	Proj2	
3	2	binil	Proj2	
4	2	livil	Proj2	
				
				
				
Person				
PersonID	PersonName			
1				
2				
3				
4				
				
Project				
ProjectID	ProjectCode	ProjectName		
1	Proj1			
2	Proj2			
				
PersonProject			PersonProject - Relation	
ProjectID	PersonID			
1	1			
1	2			
1	3			
1	4			
2	1			
2	2			
2	3			
2	4			


3NF	All attributes should directly(nontransitively) depend on primarykey. In otherwords, it should not contain derivable data.			
				
EmpName	City	County		
Anil	chennai	India		Based on city we can derive country
Sunil	chennai	India		So city is directly dependent on PK. Where as country is indirectly depend on primary key
Ginil	chennai	India		
Minil	banglore	India						
				
EmpName	City			
Anil	chennai			
Sunil	chennai			
Ginil	chennai			
Minil	banglore			
				
City	Country			
chennai	India			
banglore	India
